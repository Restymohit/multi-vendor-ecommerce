# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Marketplace Backend System

## Introduction
This backend system supports a scalable multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace similar to platforms like Etsy or Amazon. It allows multiple vendors to register, manage their product listings, process orders, and handle payments, while administrators oversee the entire marketplace operations including vendor approvals, dispute resolution, and analytics.
